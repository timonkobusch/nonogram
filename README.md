Welcome to the Nonogram Web App Repository! This is a fully functional web application for solving [nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram), also known as picross or griddlers. Nonograms are grid-based puzzles where the goal is to determine which cells in a grid should be filled and which should be empty based on numerical clues provided for each row and column.

The Web App can be found here:
